A few of my favorite projects are below:
Student Writing Helps (Website ● Github repo). A new website to host material I developed for the “Seminary Project Labs” site listed below. This version guides users through the installation and configuration of Greek and Hebrew fonts, the use of a Turabian template, and Zotero. Includes some of my old screencasts (here's one for example).
Seminary Project Labs - Greek & Hebrew fonts, Turabian, Zotero (Website). The original site that I created for the material now hosted on my Student Writing Helps site. Includes links to archived webcasts of my live teaching sessions.
Timeline of Old Testament History (Website ● Github repo). This timeline covers the history of Old Testament Israel. Because of the massive scope of Old Testament history, there is much more that I’d like to add here someday.
Bible study worksheets (Github repo). I have written study guides for several New Testament books, including John, 1 & 2 Corinthians, Ephesians, 1 & 2 Peter, 1–3 John, and Jude (among others).
