\noindent \textit{Young, educated professional seeking new opportunities for advancement and service in the Edmonton area.}\\\\

As a young professional with a diverse background in ministry, academia, and technology, I have frequently needed to rapidly acquire new skills. This variety of experiences has challenged me to grow in transferable managerial and technological skills.

With significant public speaking experience, I highly value clear and effective communication. For me, a project is not complete unless it is done well. I place a premium upon my personal character and work ethic. I pursue trust and transparency in my personal and professional affairs.

Presently, my goal is to secure a new position in the Edmonton area. I want to use my professional experience and focus on customer service as I pursue new opportunities for my career. As a continual learner, I want to build on my educational background in software development with rigorous self-education to further enhance my technical and professional skills.
