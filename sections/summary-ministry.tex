\noindent \textit{Young, educated professional with ministry experience, seeking new opportunities for advancement and service.}\\\\

As a young professional with a diverse background in technology, academia, and ministry, I have frequently needed to rapidly acquire new skills. This variety of experiences has challenged me to grow in my knowledge of the Bible, theology and church history.

With significant public speaking experience, I highly value clear and effective communication. For me, a project is not complete unless it is done well. I place a premium upon my personal character and work ethic. I pursue trust and transparency in my personal and professional affairs.

Presently, my goal is to transition from academia into the tech sector. I want to combine my experience in education with my interest in online technology to create rich experiences for learners.
