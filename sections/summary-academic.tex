\noindent \textit{Young, educated professional with ministry experience, seeking new opportunities for advancement and service.}\\\\

As a young professional with a diverse background in ministry, academia, and technology, I have frequently needed to rapidly acquire new skills. This variety of experiences has challenged me to grow in my knowledge of the Bible, theology and church history as well as transferable managerial and technological skills.

With significant public speaking experience, I highly value clear and effective communication. For me, a project is not complete unless it is done well. I place a premium upon my personal character and work ethic. I pursue trust and transparency in my personal and professional affairs.

Presently, my goal is to secure a new position in Christian higher education. I want to use my experience in education to instill a biblical legacy upon future generations. As a learner myself, I want to continue to grow in my knowledge of history and theology while continuing to develop my technical and administrative skills.
