\noindent \textit{Young, educated professional with some management experience, seeking new opportunities through a career change into the information sector.}\\

As a young professional with a diverse background in tech and Christian education, I have frequently needed to rapidly acquire new skills. This variety of experiences has challenged me to grow in transferable managerial and technological skills while also advancing my knowledge within specific fields of study.

With significant public speaking experience, I highly value clear and effective communication. For me, a project is not complete unless it is done well. I place a premium upon my personal character and work ethic. I pursue trust and transparency in my personal and professional affairs.

Presently, my goal is to transition from Christian education into the information sector. I want to combine my experience in education with my interest in online technology to create rich experiences for learners. As a continual learner, I want to complete an \acr{ALA} accredited \acr{MLIS} degree to serve as a platform for future employment.
