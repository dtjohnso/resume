\roottitle{Projects}

I have always enjoyed building online projects. A short list of some of my favorites is below, while a more comprehensive list can be found on the \href{http://duncanjohnson.ca/projects/}{``Projects'' page of my website}.

\begin{itemize}
% \item \textbf{\href{http://library.foundationbaptistcollege.com/}{library.foundationbaptistcollege.com}} - Unlike many of my other website projects (which are predominantly deployed on shared hosting), this site is a live install of the open-source \href{https://koha-community.org/}{Koha ILS} on a small Ubuntu server that I maintain.
\item \textbf{\href{http://moodle.duncanjohnson.ca/}{moodle.duncanjohnson.ca}} - An installation of the Moodle LMS that I have used with some of my courses.
\item \textbf{Student Writing Helps (\href{http://duncanjohnson.ca/Student-Writing-Helps/}{Website}; \href{https://github.com/dtjohnso/Student-Writing-Helps}{Github repo}).} A website to host material I developed for the \textit{Seminary Project Labs} project at BJU. This site guides users through the installation and configuration of Greek and Hebrew fonts, the use of a Turabian template, and Zotero. It includes some of my old screencasts that I made for the original project.
\item \textbf{A Timeline of the English Bible (\href{http://duncanjohnson.ca/English-Bible/}{Website}; \href{https://github.com/dtjohnso/English-Bible}{Github repo}).} This timeline displays the political, publishing, and translational history of the Bible in the English language. The scope of events described spans from early medieval translations to modern committee translations produced by major publishers.
